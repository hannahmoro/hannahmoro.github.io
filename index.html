<h3>More about me</h3>

<p>My full last name is Moshontz de la Rocha. I go by Hannah Moshontz professionally to avoid the hassles, misspellings, and misunderstandings that result from using my entire name.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>I have a cat named Marceline (she goes by Pickles). If you have a video meeting with me, there is a good chance she will visit.</p>

<p>I got my start in project management when I helped create <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thehumblevelocipede/the-humble-velocipede" style="color:#81A88D">a successful Kickstarter project</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trail_glazer/" style="color:#81A88D">make pottery sometimes</a>.</p>
